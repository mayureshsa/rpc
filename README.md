# rpc
Remote Procedural Calling Simulation using ServerSockets in Java language.
Programs here are used to simulate RPC using a single machine wherein each java file needs to be executed on an individual command prompt. Thus giving a feel of Client Server architecture.
Note: If you have to connect to a remote server, make necessary changes in ip adrress and port number of the server for the communication to take place.
Steps:
Initially, start the Server by running the EchoServer1B.java, and then then clients (ClientCalcB.java and ClientString.java) and follow the menu driven program on the client machine.
